// Possible solutions to the Tailwind CSS styling issue:

// 1. Verify Tailwind CSS Configuration:
//   - Ensure that the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) is correctly configured and that the paths to your CSS files are specified.
//   - Check that the `content` array includes all the files where you are using Tailwind classes.
//   - Check the purge setting or the mode setting in the `tailwind.config.js` file

// 2. Build Process:
//   - If you are using a build process (like Webpack, Vite, etc.), ensure that the Tailwind CSS build step is correctly configured.  If you are not using a build process, you might need to.

// 3. CSS Specificity:
//   - Check for conflicting CSS styles. More specific CSS rules from other sources could be overriding your Tailwind CSS classes. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and see if there is anything overriding your Tailwind classes.

// 4. Typos:
//   - Double-check your Tailwind CSS class names for any typos.

// 5. Browser Cache:
//   - Clearing your browser's cache can help resolve issues where an outdated version of the CSS is being used.

// 6. Incorrect import or use of Tailwind Directives:
//   - Make sure you are correctly importing Tailwind CSS and using the `@tailwind` directives in your main CSS file.
